Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/performance#python_or_tensor_args and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","[[ 64.67285]\n"," [ 86.53339]\n"," [108.39392]\n"," [130.25446]\n"," [152.11499]\n"," [173.97552]\n"," [195.83606]]\n","[[184.90579]]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
